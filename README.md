# ConnectorSites
I am making a site repo like google but for fun. 


Sites can be made here, the file has to be made in replit and should be commented on Connector which is in DeadWither's replit account.
I have to verify the file add it here and its raw file link to a repl.

The site can be a a Python file or HTML file with all CSS and JS in that file. The Python file can have modules imported and a flask framework.
The HTML should not have any APIs, they can be included but might not work.
