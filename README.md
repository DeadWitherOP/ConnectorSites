# ConnectorSites
I am making a site repo like google but for fun. 


Sites can be made here, the file has to be made in replit and should be commented on Connector which is in DeadWither's replit account.
I have to verify the file add it here and its raw file link to a repl.

The site can be a a Python file or a text file. The Python file can have modules imported and a flask framework.
If you are a maker of a "site", you will be given your link
